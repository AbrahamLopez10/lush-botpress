A service that connects Botpress and Lush's internal GraphQL API, Wyvern, would act as a bridge between the two systems, allowing them to communicate and exchange data seamlessly. Botpress is a chatbot development platform, while Wyvern is Lush's internal GraphQL API. By integrating these two systems, the service enables Botpress to make queries and mutations to the Wyvern API, retrieving and updating data as needed. This integration enhances the functionality of the chatbot by leveraging the data and capabilities provided by the Wyvern API. The service handles the authentication and authorization process, ensuring that only authorized requests are made to the Wyvern API. It also handles any necessary data transformations or mappings between the Botpress and Wyvern data models. Overall, this integration service enables Botpress to leverage the power of Lush's internal GraphQL API, Wyvern, and provide a more robust and dynamic chatbot experience.
